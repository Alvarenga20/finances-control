This is one of the projects I was most excited to work on. I created it for a friend who was struggling with managing his personal finances. It's a tracker I built helps him analyze and gain better control over his finances.

I also took the opportunity to add some basic features like login and signup authentication. Additionally, I designed it to be open for further improvements, such as making it suitable for companies or incorporating AI to enhance financial management.

Some of technologies that I used the most are:

-React
-React Router
-TypeScript
-Tailwind CSS
-Chart.js
-Context API
-Firebase

Please, share your feedback with me
